# Aquatic Remote Sensing

## Reflectance terminology

### Definitions and theory

Videos: https://www.ioccg.org/training/lectures.html

> Read about normalized reflectances [here]( https://www.oceanopticsbook.info/view/atmospheric-correction/normalized-reflectances)

* [Overview from ocean optics book](https://www.oceanopticsbook.info/view/inherent-and-apparent-optical-properties/reflectances) of $R_{rs}$ vs. $R$ - better AOP because it is less sensitive to sky conditions while remaining very sensitive to different IOPs
* **Remote sensing reflectance** $R_{rs}(\lambda)$ ($sr^-1$) is ratio of water leaving *radiance* to total downwelling irradiance
* **Reflectance** $R(\lambda)$ (unitless) can be defined as ratio of subsurface upwelling irradiance ($E_u^-(\lambda)$) (flux per unit surface area) to subsurface downwelling irradiance ($E_d^-(\lambda)$), and is a function of the surface (specific IOPs and concentrations/abundance of water constituents), illumniation, and observation angles (but not on the instrument or irradiance received). Albedo is the average over the whole spectrum. 
* **Radiance** measures flux per unit area and per unit solid angle. $L(\theta, \phi)$ is the radiance in direction of zenith (vertical) angle $\theta$ and azimuth (horizontal) angle $\phi$. Integrate $L$ over the appropriate angles to get **irradiance**. 
* Normalized water-leaving reflectance $R_w$ from atmospheric correction
* **Scalar irradiance** $(E_0)$ is the flux received by a spherical collector from all directions. This concept (how flux varies by direction) is needed to account for the portion of the signal that the sensor sees compared to all of the water-leaving irradiance.



$$R(\lambda, z) = \frac{E_u(\lambda, z)}{E_d(\lambda, z)}$$
$$R_{rs}(\theta, \phi, \lambda, 0) = \frac{L(\theta, \phi, \lambda, 0)}{E_d(\lambda, 0)}$$
A proportionality factor $Q(\theta, \phi, \lambda)$ in units of [sr] can relate $R_{RS}$ to $R$. (also called the light distribution factor, Q).

NEON measurements are non-dimensional reflectance ($\\rho = \frac{\pi L}{cos\theta_0 (F_0)}$). $F_0$ is extraterrestrial solar irradiance, and ATCOR is used for atmospheric correction (assume this approximates $E_d$, or ($F_0 f_s t_{ds})$) (variations in earth-sun distance and transmittance of diffuse radiation through atmosphere.) Not accounted for is BDRF (assume BDRF = 1). Also assumes that $L_w$ (water-leaving radiance) is $L_{total}$, i.e. no glint/reflected light ($L_r = 0$). $\theta$ is the [solar zenith angle](https://www.usgs.gov/land-resources/nli/landsat/solar-illumination-and-sensor-viewing-angle-coefficient-files), where smaller values mean sun closest to nadir.

$$\rho = \frac{\pi L}{cos\theta_0 (E_d)}
\\R_{rs} = \frac{L_w}{E_d} \times f_{bdrf}(\lambda)
\\R_{rs} = \rho \times \frac{\cos\theta_s}{\pi}$$

* Balasubramanian et al 2020 RSE use $R_{rs} = \rho_w/\pi$

$\pi$ is the light distribution factor ($Q = \frac{E_u}{L_u}$ [$sr^{-1}$]), assuming an *isotropic light field*, where light is reflected evenly in all directions.

### Surface to Subsurface Reflectance 

Airborne measurements are surface reflectance ($R_{rs}$ or $R_{rs}(0+)$), affected by refraction and such at the surface of the water. There's the widely used Gordon et al 1988 model (standard NASA approach) to convert surface to subsurface reflectance ($r_{rs}$ or $R_{rs}(0-)$) - more directly related to IOPS - as well as several alternatives (see appendix A in Werdell et al. 2018). (The two following equations are the same just different notation for surface/subsurface)


$$R_{rs}(0-) = \frac{R_{rs}(0+)}{0.52 + 1.7\ R_{rs}(0+)}
\\r_{rs} = \frac{R_{rs}(\lambda)}{0.52 + 1.7\ R_{rs}(\lambda)}$$

In most cases (reflectance below 0.3 $sr^{-1}$), subsurface remote sensing reflectance is modeled to be a small percentage higher than surface remote sensing reflectance. So what is observed at the water surface is slightly less reflectance than right below water surface.  (could potentially   test this with comparison of PAR above and below)

```{r, echo = FALSE}
xx <- seq(0.01, 0.5, by = 0.001)
yy = xx/(0.52 + 1.7*xx)

data.frame(xx, yy) %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = xx, y = yy)) +
  geom_line(col = 'blue') +
  geom_abline(slope = 1, intercept = 0, lty = 2) +
  theme_bw() +
  xlab('Surface R_rs') + ylab('Subsurface r_rs')
```


### Subsurface Reflectance as a function of IOPs

**Gordon et al 1975, 1998** model for remote sensing reflectance just below the water surface based on Monte Carlo simulations. See Lee et al 2002 for some discussion of g1 and g2. 

$$r_{rs}(\lambda) = \frac{L_u(0^-,\lambda)}{E_d(0^-,\lambda)} = g_1\bigg(\frac{b_b(\lambda)}{a(\lambda) + b_b(\lambda)}\bigg) + g_2\bigg(\frac{b_b(\lambda)}{a(\lambda) + b_b(\lambda)}\bigg)^2$$

* $\frac{b_b}{(a + b_b)}$ in Gordon model can be referred to as $u$. 
* G1 = 0.0949, G2 = 0.0794, or Lee et al. coefficients
* G coefficients represent illumination, geometry, and sea surface properties

### Normalized reflectance

* making the spectra all 0-1
* median centering and interquartile scaling used in Balasubramian et al 2020

## Atmospheric correction and Glint

* Sensor measurement is upwelling radiance $L_u$, which includes both $L_w$ and reflected radiance from the water surface $L_r$ which has not interacted with the water column and needs to be removed. 
$L_u = L_w + L_r$

* Review of methods in **Kay et al 2009**
* In general, methods for high resolution images make no assumptions about the angle of the water surface and instead use image-based information with the assumption of no NIR water leaving radiance
* $R^{surf}_{rs}(\lambda)$ is reflections at the water surface (glint)
* POLYMER (Steinmetz et al 2011) shown to work well with MSI, OLCI in optically complex waters 
* ACOLITE (v20190326.0) commonly used in highly turbid waters
* NEON uses ATCOR, which is proprietary but relies a lot on the value of the aerosol optical thickness which is based on observations over "dark dense vegetation".
* Pahlevan et al 2021 review atmospheric correction for Landsat and Sentinel, comparing to validation data sets. Median errors are 20-30% for the best performing processors, which propagates to 25-75% uncertainty in derived chl a and TSS products.
* Learn more about FLAASH [here](https://www.l3harrisgeospatial.com/docs/flaash.html)

## Water absorption and scattering

* varies with temperature and salinity
* Use `approx` to interpolate published spectra to 1 nm.
* water spectra saved in `data/water-approx1nm.csv`
* Assume backscattering is half of scattering coefficient

$b_{b,w} = 0.5 b_w$

![](figs/pure-water-rrs.png)

* more absorption data and links compiled [here](https://omlc.org/spectra/water/abs/) 
* Pope and Fry 1997 absorption 380-700 nm at 2.5 nm res,
also with standard deviations
* Comparison plot (Figure 10) to Buiteveld et al, Tam and Patel, Smith and Baker 1981, and Sogandares and Fry

## CDOM absorption

* operationally defined based on 0.2 um pore size of filters
* absorption decreases in a near-expondential manner from UV to far visible wavelengths declining to near zero between 650 and 700 nm
* modeled with a fixed shape (exponential). 
* Shape associated superposition of chromophores or charge transfer process
* absorption losses in different regions of UV have been linked to different processes. UVC (100-280 nm), UVB (280-315), UVA (315-400)
* **photobleaching** is the loss of absorption, directly linked to exposure to natural sunlight
* natural log absorbance ($m^{-1}$) = $2.303  \times \frac{A}{L(m)}$ for A log10
* To covert a base 10 logarithm to a natural logarithm, multiply by loge10 (=2.303).
* below 500 nm, photodegradation increases spectral slope and above 510 nm, photodegraded CDOM decreases spectral slope (Loiselle et al 2009)
* optimal wavelength interval is 20 nm, report center wavelength eg. $S_{250}$ for 240-259 nm
* E2:E3 is the ratio of absorption at 250 and 365 and is associated with relative size of DOM molecules (Helms et al 2008)
* E4:E6 is ratio of absorption at 465 and 665 and is associated with CDOM aromaticity, molecular size, atom ratios, etc. and a general tracer of humification
* SUVA 254 (UV absorption at 254 normalized to DOC content) correlates with DOM aromaticity (Weishaar et al 2003)



$$
a^*_{dg}(\lambda) = exp(-S_{dg}\lambda)
$$
* $S_{dg}$ either a constant value between 0.01- 0.02, region-specific value, or estimated from blue (443) to green (555 or 547) reflectance ratio. Probably inverse relationship with a_{dg}(440). 

$$
S_{dg} = 0.015 + \frac{0.002}{0.6 + r_{rs}(443)/r_{rs}(55x)}
$$

* $S_{cdom}$ range 0.01-0.03 and $S_{nap}$ range 0.005-0.015
* getting cdom spectral slope from satellite data could provide indicator of source, molecular size, aromatic content, and extent of photochemical vs microbial degradation of organic matter
* NAP spectral slope can inform proportion of mineral and organic matter (Babin et al 2003)
* absorbance in red can be significant at high CDOM concentrations
* most prominent in UV and blue regions (<500 nm)
* Colored dissolved organic matter, also known as gelbstoff, yellow substance,
or gilvin. Assumed not to scatter light because pigments are totally dissolved.
* Absorption maxima of chromophores are in the UV, such as 180, 203, 253 nm for
benzene (common aromatic ring structure in humic matter)
* tail of those peaks is approximated by: 

$$a_{CDOM}(\lambda) = a_{CDOM}(\lambda_0) \times {exp}( -S \times (\lambda - \lambda_{0}))$$

* mean values for $S$ are 0.016-0.017 $nm^{-1}$, sd 0.002 $nm^{-1}$, variation is due to composition. Range 0.008 - 0.042 $nm^{-1}$

* CDOM concentration (Y) (proxy for DOC) can be expressed in units of absorption 
at $\lambda_0$, usually around 400 nm. 

$$Y = a_{CDOM}(\lambda_{0})[m^{-1}]$$
* Gaussian decomposition method important for terrestrially influence (**Grunert et al 2018**) especially based on lignin absorbance around 276 nm


## CDOM algorithms

* Zhu et al 2014 RSE assessment of CDOM algorithms in freshwater
* Zhang et al 2015 for spectral slope (different intercept for different optical water types):

$$
Y_{cdm} = 0.015 + \bigg(\frac{0.002}{0.6 + r_rs(443)/r_{rs}(560)}\bigg)
\\Y_{cdm} = 0.019 + \bigg(\frac{0.002}{0.6 + r_rs(443)/r_{rs}(560)}\bigg)
$$


* ratio of 670/571 nm to estimate humic color (used in Menken et al 2006)

* Particulate organic carbon algorithm for [ocean color](https://oceancolor.gsfc.nasa.gov/atbd/poc/) is power law applied to blue (443) /green (between 547-565) band ratio 

$$
poc = a \times \bigg(\frac{R_{rs}443}{R_{rs}555}\bigg)^b
\\a = 203.2
\\b = -1.034
$$

## Phytoplankton absorption background

* either a single spectral shape for $a^*_{ph}(\lambda)$, multiple spectra based on different pigment-based taxonomic groups, or empirically derived Gaussian-based approximations (8 approaches in table 1 of Werdell et al 2018, all based on concentration and some basis for normalized absorption spectra)
* species-specific algal pigment absorption: cyanobacteria have phycobiliproteins, diatoms have fucoxanthin, and dinoflagellates have peridinin
* Aguirre-Gomez et al 2001 table 1 has position of peaks of pigments for
diatoms, green algae, chl a, chl b, chl c1, chl c2, beta-carotene, 
fucoxanthin
* cyanobacteria: 620-625 nm is region of phycocyanin absorption and 592 nm is region of B-phycoerythrin absorption (both indicators of cyanobacteria)
* variations based on type and relative concentrations of phytoplankton, physiological responses to growth conditions including light, nutrient availability, and temperature
* Phaeopigments are partial degradation products of chlorophyll. Absorb more strongly at 412 nm, whereas chl absorbance peaks are 443 nm and low absorbance at 412
* Babin et al 2003 found that in some coastal areas (europe) high pheopigment concentrations gave rise to especially high blue-to-red ratio of phytoplankton absorption - a departure from general trend usually found for open oceanic waters for relationship between phytoplankton absorption and chlorophyll concentration
* causes absorbance minumum near 440 nm
* carotenoids absorbance minimum near 490 nm
* green reflectance peak near 550 nm because green algae absorb strongly in red and blue
* reflectance minimum at 670 nm from chl a absorbance
* reflectance peak at 700 nm is from combined effect chl a absorbance and particulate scattering
* less influence in blue region, at least compared to CDOM and particulate scattering
* chlorophyll flouorescence peak is around 680-710 nm, and chl absorption max is between 665-680 nm
* there is no functional algorithm to estimate chl a from hyperspectral rs across a wide range of trophic conditions
* QAA (Lee et al 2002) algorithm, primarily intended for moderately turbid coastal and clear ocean waters but used extensively in aquatic studies
* Generalized IOP inversion (Werdell et al 2013) algorithm, primarily intended for moderately turbid coastal and clear ocean waters but used extensively in aquatic studies

* trophic status can be classified based on chl a concentration:
  * oligotrophic: chl a < 8 ug/L
  * mesotrophic: chl a between 8 and 25 ug/L
  * eutrophic: chla > 25 ug/L
  * humic (regardless of chla), high concentration of humus and low tss

chl conc (ug/L) * specific absorption (m2/mg)

Unit conversion: m2/mg * ug/L = 1/m

chla = sum of chl a AND pheophytin (Albert and Mobley 2003)

## Chl a algorithms

* From Appendix of Pahlevan et al 2020
* 48 chl a algorithms assessed in Neil et al 2019 with 2,807 in situ spectra. Best performance by allowing model type and parameterisation to vary based on optical water types
* categories: blue/green ratios used in open ocean waters (eg. 440/550 or 488/551), NIR/red (eg. 700/670) used in more turbid and eutrophic waters (chl a > 3 mg/m3), peak height relative to baseline, and neural networks (to estimate $a_{phy}$), semi-analytical (to estimate $a_{phy}$)
* Chl a relationship to $a_{phy}(443)$ (Bricaud et al 1998, used in Neil et al 2019)
* Menken et al 2006 found ratio of 700/670 best for chl a over wide variety of conditions

> 1. **OC2** (MSI, multi-spectral, O'Reilly and Werdell 2019)

* ocean chl a, based on blue-green ratio. expect non linear increase in green compared to blue with higher chl a absorption and scattering
* empirically-derived, performed well in Neil et al. 2019 calibration study
* for oligo and mesotrophic waters (< 10 mg/m3)
* can confused turbid or CDOM rich waters with high chl a (higher reflectance in green and/or decrease in blue)

sometimes $R_{rs}$ and sometimes $R_w$

$$
x = log_{10}\frac{R_{rs}(492)}{R_{rs}(560)}
\\

$$
> 2. **OC3** (MSI, multi-spectral, O'Reilly and Werdell 2019)

* empirically-derived, performed well in Neil et al. 2019 calibration study
* for oligo and mesotrophic waters

$$
x = log_{10}\frac{max(R_{rs}(442), R_{rs}(492))}{R_{rs}(560)}
\\
y = 0.3308 - 2.6684x + 1.5990x^2 - 0.5525x^3 - 1.4876x^4
\\
Chl_{OC3} = 10^y
$$

> 3. **OC4** (OLCI, multi-spectral, O'Reilly and Werdell 2019)

adapted for 443/490/510 and 555 as descrbied in Moore et al 2014 section 2.2 (same form different coefficients)

$$
x = log_{10} [max(R_{rs}(442), R_{rs}(490), R_{rs}(510)) \times R_{rs}(560)]^{-1}
\\
y = 0.4254 - 3.2168x + 2.8691x^2 - 0.6263x^3 - 1.0933x^4
\\
Chl_{OC4} = 10^y
$$
> 4. **OCx** - MSI (O'Reilly and Werdell 2019)

$$
CI = R_{rs}(560) - (0.473 \times R_{rs}(442)) - (0.527 \times R_{rs}(665))
\\
Chl_{CI} = 10^{-0.4909 + 191.6590 \times CI}
\\
w = \frac{(Chl_{CI} - 0.15)}{(0.20 - 0.15)}
$$
* chl OCx depends on value of $Chl_{CI}$ (3 different ranges for below 0.15 mg/m3, above 0.20 mg/m3, in between)
* only valid for CI less than -0.005 sr ?

> 5. **OCx** - OCLI (Hu et al 2012, O'Reilly and Werdell 2019)

* same as MSI but uses OC4 instead of OC3 for mid and high ranges of chl (above 0.15 mg/m3)

> 6. **2-Band** (Moses et al 2012)

$$
Chl_{2band} = (35.75 \times \frac{R_{rs}(708)}{R_{rs}(665)} - 19.3)^{1.124}
$$
> 7. **3-Band** (Moses et al 2009b)

$$
Chl_{3band} = 232.329 \times (R_{rs}(665)^{-1} - R_{rs}(708)^{-1}) \times R_{rs}(753) + 23.17
$$

> 8. **Blend** (Smith et al 2018)

* phi ($\phi$) is between 0.75 and 1.15 depending on value of r

$$
r = \frac{R_{rs}(708)}{R_{rs}(665)}
\\
w = \frac{(\phi - 0.75)}{(1.15 - 0.75)}
\\
Chl_{Blend} = w \times Chl_{2band} + abs(w -1) \times Chl_{OCx}
$$

> 9. **NDCI** (Mishra and Mishra 2012)

* uses spectral band difference at 709 nm and 685 nm but normalies by the sum of the two relfectances to reduce differences in solar and atmospheric variability

$$
Chl_{NDCI} = a + b \times \bigg( \frac{R_{rs}(708)-R_{rs}(665)}{R_{rs}(708)+R_{rs}(665)}\bigg) + c \times \bigg(\frac{R_{rs}(708)-R_{rs}(665)}{R_{rs}(708)+R_{rs}(665)}\bigg)^2
\\
a = 14.039 \\ b = 86.11 \\c = 194.325
$$
> 10. Gons (Gons et al. 2002, 2005, 2008)

* semi-analytical 
* ratio of NIR and red (eg. 708/665 nm) with additional coefficients for $a_w(665)$, $a_w(709)$, $a^*_{chl}(665)$, $b^p_b$
* validated over waters with range of 3-185 mg/m3 chla 

$$
chla = \frac{\big(\frac{R_w708}{R_w665}\big)\times(a_w709+b_b)-a_w665-b^p_b}{a^*_{chl}(665)}
\\b^b = \frac{0.6 \times a_w779 \times R_w779}{0.082 - 0.6 \times R_w779}
$$

> 11. Gilerson 2 band

* generic empirical NIR-red ratio (Gilerson et al 2010)
* performed well in Neil et al. 2019 calibration study
* can be tuned over a large range of moderately turbid waters
* ratio of NIR and red bands (eg. 708/665 nm), based on red absorption peak of chl a and NIR only water
* better suited to waters with moderate to high chl a (2-200 mg/m3)
* longer wavebands show less overlap in absorption between substances, so better where CDOM and particulates do not necessarily covary with chl a

$$
chla = (ax-b)^c
\\ x = \frac{R_w(708)}{R_w(665)}
$$
* a, b, c are coefficients subjected to calibration

> 12. Maximum Chlorophyll Index (MCI) or Fluorescent Line height (FLH)

* Both take the same form - height or depth of spectral peak or trough over/under baseline from two surrounding bands (see Kravitz et al 2020). $\lambda_2$ is the peak/trough and 1 and 3 are neighboring reflectances. FLH peaks at 681 nm (OLCI) and 709 (MCI)
* MPH finds highest peak in red/NIR (Matthews et al. 2012, Matthews and Odermatt 2015), flags each pixel as dominated by cyanobacteria or algae and calculates chl a from empircal relationship

$$
chla \propto R(\lambda_2) - R(\lambda_1) + \bigg(R(\lambda_1) - R(\lambda_3)\frac{\lambda_2-\lambda_1}{\lambda_3-\lambda_1}\bigg)
$$

## Particulate backscattering

* water and particulates ($b_{bp}(\lambda)$)
* particulates sometimes partitioned into organic/inorganic or large/small sized, or phyto/non-algal
* spectral shape described with power law:

$$
b^*_{bp}(\lambda) = \lambda^{-S_{bp}}
$$

* $S_{bp}$ varies between 0 and 3, presumably depending on particle size distribution
* other approaches not assuming power law spectra in Werdell et al 2018 2.1.4.3

$$ 
Y_{bbp} = 2\times\bigg(1-1.2\exp\Big(-0.9\frac{r_{rs}(443)}{r_{rs}(560)}\Big)\bigg)
$$

## Turbidity or TSS algorithms

* site-specific studies often utilize a single red band for TSS retrievals, which can provide reasonably accurate estimates within limited TSS ranges, either linear regression or higher order polynomials. 
* Performance of single red-band algorithms degrades in areas with extreme sediment loads because of a saturation effect. Then bands longer than 700 nm are used such as 865, 1020, or 1071 (but they don't work as well at low to moderate TSS eg. below 50 g/m3 because water absorption signal is stronger than particulate backscattering. 
* TSS categories in Balasubramian et al 2020: type 1 Rrs560 < Rrs492, type 2 is 665 < 560 and 665 > 492 and 560 > 492, type 3 665 > 560 and 740 > 0.01/sr (check for green water, then brown water, then blue-green water which is optically mixed with no dominant constituent)

$$

$$

## Fluorescence background

* **Culver and Perry 1997** discuss calculations; chl a fluorescence can account for 10-40% upwelled irradiance at surface and 80% in subsurface
* solar-induced chla flourescence peak emission band for CHL around 681 nm (Gower et al 1999), 680-710
* Fluorescence by dissolved organic matter influences the blue part of the spectrum, with a centre wavelength ∼ 430 nm, whereas phycoerythrin fluorescence is centred around 585nm, and chlorophyll-a fluorescence at about 685nm.
* Vigneshwaran et al 2015 used hydrolight models. chl fluorescence is in red around 685-720 nm (with high productivity). Suggest that the magnitude and peak position of those wavelengths could indicate phytoplankton concentrations




# Methods and approaches

* Mixture Density Networks - a class of neural networks, Pahlevan et al 2020. Uses all available spectral bands to determine most suitable band combinations for various water types

# Goodness of fit

* RMSE - more comprehensive than bias or MARE because it combines the mean and variance of the error distribution into a single term
* bias (average difference) - speaks to systematic offsets
* median absolute relative error (MARE)
* Non-linear least squares minimization
* Cauchy loss function to reduce effect of large outliers on convergence
* Pahlevan et al 2021 RSE - median symmetric accuracy ($\epsilon$) and summetric signed percentage bias ($\beta$)

$$
\epsilon = 100 \times (10^Y-1)
\\ Y = Median \big|log_{10}(\hat{q}/q)\big|
\\
\beta = 100 \times sign(Z)(10^{|Z|}-1)
\\ Z = Median(log_{10}(\hat{q}/q))
$$

# Temporal overlaps

* Pahlevan et al 2021 RSE use plus or minus 3 hours of HICO image acquisitions (105 chl a matchups)
